# Email Development Portfolio

This project brings together standard templates for email development, as well as typical web development projects affiliated with the email marketing campaign cycle. The goal is to showcase good design and development practices for modern, professional email marketing. I have selected five projects that I think belong in every Email Dev portfolio: an email promotion, an email newsletter, an email receipt, and two landing pages.

Am I taking on new opportunities? Yes. Please contact me to discuss your project, schedule a talk, or just pick my brain.

Can you follow me on social media? Sure. Links are on the bottom and I tend to follow back.

Would you like for more info? Of course. You can check out my F.A.Q. page or read some of my articles.
