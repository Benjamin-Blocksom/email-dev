## Project

Promotional email with the following request:

"...Can you put something like this together for the brewery in an email blast like the example you sent me?  i.e. happy holidays, we love our customers, our holiday hours are (24th 2-6pm and 31st 2-6pm all other hours the same - look on the website), come fill your growlers and pick up your Loudoun Brewing favorite cans: #Love Loudoun, Nebulous Too and United.

Linda is working on getting the distro list.  I saw a cool holiday theme header for the email which I'll send separately.

I hope you are around to get this out by Tuesday morning.  I know it's short notice but I just thought of your first email blast at the last minute..."
