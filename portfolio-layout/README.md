## Current Changes Needed

1) ~~Launch. This needs to go live.~~ A site is live at https://www.benjaminblocksom.com

2) ~~Modify design so it is inspired by Jen Simmons' site, not copied from it.~~ Current site has different layout.

3) Update card section. Standardize size, have them launch a modal and link to a live site where applicable.
