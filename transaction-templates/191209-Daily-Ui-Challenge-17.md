## Daily UI Design Challenge #017: E-mail Receipt

Part of a series where we code HTML e-mail designs.

The first design I tackled was done by Elena Perminova, who created a receipt for an oak dining chair. To present her design, she placed two versions side-by-side on a black backdrop. That I could tell, the versions are the same except for the colors. The dimensions look mobile-ready and I could readily identify five sections that would need to be coded:
  1) The top perforated-paper image which gives it the look of an old-time ticket.
  2) An image of chair with text in the upper-right corner
  3) The transaction table with a description of product, subtotal, shipping, tax, and total.
  4) A "thank-you" message
  5) Buttons to track the order and order details.

The `order-details` button left me a bit confused. This is a receipt, after all, and it should include all relevant details on it, otherwise it is just a product card.

As a side project, it might be neat to develop an ACO reader that creates a CSS variable declaration.
